            <h2>Clean Design</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://vintagerevivalsshop.com">Vintage Revivals</a></h3>
            <img src="images/IMG_6221.PNG" alt="Vintage Revivals Mobile" />
            <p>Vintage Revivals has managed to present a mobile experience that is clean and well designed. I like how
                they make the shopping experience simple by not overcrowding the homepage, they use whitespace to
                provide a calm browser experience, allowing the user to focus on the product potography.</p>

        <section class="repetition">
            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en">Specialized</a></h3>
            <img src="images/IMG_6223.PNG" alt="Specialized Mobile" />
            <p>Specialized utilizes repetition in their button design, their use of dark and light grey to differentiate
                between the options they offer is a subtle choice that I think works very well.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="thirds">
            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.espn.go.com">ESPN</a></h3>
            <img src="images/IMG_6220.PNG" alt="ESPN Mobile" />
            <p>I think that ESPN's mobile site gives a good example of applying the rule of thirds. Maybe the best
                example is the location of their logo in the top left corner of the page. It's easy to find and calls
                attention to itself without overpowering the main story.</p>
