                    <p>I always said I needed to eat better and exercise more, I hadn't felt very healthy for a while,
                        but finding the time to do it seemed impossible. During a routine visit to the doctor, I was
                        informed that if I didn't make some health changes myself, pretty soon some changes would be
                        decided for me. That was the wake-up call I needed.
                        Finding time was one challenge, but knowing how and what to eat and how and when to exercise was
                        a whole other challenge entirely. I found whatever resources I could, wherever I could, and did
                        my best to follow my new routine. With a lot of effort, the results came, but I couldn't help
                        but think that all of this could be easier if there was one place to go for all of the
                        information I had gathered.
                        Shape Shifter was built to make something hard a little easier. It's not about how you look,
