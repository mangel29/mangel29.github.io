                    <p class="faq-answer-1">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found
                        however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially
                        enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that
                        their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very
                        few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful
                        in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids
                        which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been
                        proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of
                        which are even true!</p>

                    <h2 class="faq-question-2">Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still
                        come?</h2>
                    <p class="faq-answer-2">As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of
                        risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all
                        start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and
                        injuries that occur on land.
                        Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
                        device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give
                        you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should
                        prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.</p>

                        bag, foam pad, waterproof duffle bag, small waterproof day bag, tent and a cot, eating utensils

                        the morning and evening hours. You may bring beer, liquor and soft drinks (in reasonable
                        amounts, 2 cans per day). You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on

                    <p class="faq-answer-5">Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's
                        describe a common day on the river.
                        Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful
                        starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then
                        pack your things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift
                        water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp
                        around 4 or 5, after setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the
                        river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like
                        steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch
                        oven brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide
                        into another story or two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were
                        possible.</p>

                    <p class="faq-answer-6">If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance.
                        If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
