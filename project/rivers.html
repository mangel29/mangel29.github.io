                    <p class="rivers-paragraph-1">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the
                        Salmon
                        river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living
                        near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged
                        beauty
                        of the river that they never left.

                        Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
                        also
                        commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
                        over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.

                        Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                        undammed
                        rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in
                        the
                        early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                        summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's
                        slower,
                        warmer water more.</p>

                    <p class="rivers-paragraph-2">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate
                        land
                        anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone
                        cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip
                        runs
                        from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
                        scenery,
                        interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great
                        whitewater opportunities.

                        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days

                        Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
                        uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                    <p class="rivers-paragraph-3">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
                        river trips. You will never
                        forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.

                        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one
                        truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater
                        rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

                        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                        technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river
                        variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we
                        often refer to both.</p>
