        <p class="home-paragraph-1">We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why we
          subscribe to the dry
          oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and notice
          the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

        <h2 class="home-headline-2">We run Whitewater for the Rush.</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We
          believe that that
          tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
          appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>
