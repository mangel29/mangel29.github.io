    <p>I was born and raised in southern California, but I can't afford living there, so I live in Salt Lake City, Utah
        (although these days I almost can't afford to live here either).</p>

    <p>My wife and I have 3 sons, the oldest is in kindergarten so things rarely slow down for us. We love to travel
        together, mostly road trips. Our favorite places we've driven to have got to be Yellowstone and Disneyland.</p>
    <p>I served a mission in the Ecuador Quito Mission.</p>
    <p>I'm majoring in Applied Technology and I'm hoping to pivot toward a career in web development. My wife is a
        graphic designer and I hope to be able to work with her on future projects.</p>
